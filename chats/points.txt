ChatGPT
In Danish soccer, teams are typically awarded points for wins, draws, and losses as follows:

Win (W): A team is awarded 3 points for a win in a match.
Draw (D): Each team is awarded 1 point in the case of a draw (when the match ends with the same score for both teams).
Loss (L): A team does not receive any points for a loss.
This points system is commonly used in soccer leagues around the world and is also used in Danish soccer competitions to determine team standings and rankings.
