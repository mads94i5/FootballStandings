This paragraph is describing a requirement or expectation related to a solution for a specific task or project. Let's break it down:

The solution must contain a markdown document: This part indicates that the solution you provide should include a document written in Markdown format. Markdown is a lightweight markup language commonly used for formatting text, creating documentation, and writing on platforms like GitHub.

outlining the solution: In the Markdown document, you need to explain the details of your solution. This could include a description of what the solution does, how it works, and any relevant technical information.

the usage (how I should read it): This part is asking you to provide information on how to use or interact with your solution. Essentially, you should explain to the reader how they should go about using the solution you've provided. This could involve instructions, examples, or usage guidelines.

and the rule/error help information (README.md): In addition to the main Markdown document, you're also expected to include a separate file named "README.md." This file should contain information related to any rules or guidelines that the user should follow when using your solution, as well as information on how to handle errors or common issues that may arise during its use.

In summary, the paragraph is specifying that your solution should consist of two Markdown documents: one outlining the solution itself, including its functionality and technical details, and another (named README.md) providing instructions on how to use the solution correctly, along with guidance on handling errors or rule violations. This is a common practice in software development and documentation to ensure that users can easily understand and work with your solution.
